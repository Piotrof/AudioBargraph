# AudioBargraph
This is a project for a microncontrollers course at my univeristy. 

The requirements of the project are:

The task is to create a simple audio spectrum analyzer (or rather a bargraph) that presents selected
frequencies contribution in the output signal. The module should work with a single audio channel and
should be supplied with +12 to +24V power supply. Bargraph should be done using an LCD graphical
display.

The project was realized using KiCAD for the schematics and Visual Studio Code for the codebase.
